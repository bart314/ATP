# Assessment and learning outcomes

## Assessment
The weekly study- assignments will be accompanied with (rather open) questions, which will challenge students to relate works with the topic at hand (or the other way around) and to come up with other examples that illustrate the same point. Apart from that, students are encouraged to make use of their own creativity and create work that illustrates the topics under consideration

In all these cases, students need to explain why these works actually form an illustration of this topic. So the work is to be accompanied by a small piece of text that makes this work a convincing example. 

## Learning outcomes

During the offcourse, participants will

-	Present their own arguments orally and engage in constructive debate.
-	Conduct independent artistic research on a philosophical topic by finding, assessing, and employing relevant artworks and literature.
-	Understand the impact of the history of philosophy on current views on art, morality, reality and freedom.
-	Boldly and effectively question traditional answers to enduring questions.
-	Apply contextualist and analytic methods to interpret historically significant answers to artistic questions

After completion of this offcourse, participants will

-	Understand the relationship between art and technology, both in a historical and in a contemporary sense.
-	Understand the sociological and philosophical issues related to art and technology.
-	Apply their knowledge to evaluate technological and artistic practices, developments and artifacts.
-	Apply the learned methodology to position themselves within the debate concerning art and technology.
-	Be able to reflect critically (orally, written, and/or using other media) on statements concerning the relationship between art and technology.
-	Use the gained insights to improve reasoning about their own artistic practice and to position themselves within the tradition.

## Portfolio

All this makes for a portfolio that is to be delivered when the offcourse is finished. This portfolio will be assessed both artistically and philosophically. Though form and format of the portfolio is free, the questions below can be used as guidance:

-	Is the portfolio __complete__? Does it contain answers to the questions that were raised during the offcourse?
-	Is the portfolio __thorough__? Do the answers prove to be interesting, complete, thorough, detailed, ...?
-	Is the portfolio __creative__? Does it contain creative and novel ideas and insights? 
-	Is the portfolio __convincing__? Do the works and the texts gathers in the portfolio actually make sense?

Feedback on the portfolio will be given during the whole course of the offcourse. Since the form of the portfolio is free, it is not possible to state up front what materials students will be needing.
